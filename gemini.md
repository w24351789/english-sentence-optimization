# Project: Fine-tuning a T5 Model with PyTorch for English Sentence Optimization

**Author:** Ted Tai
**Date:** October 6, 2025

## 1. Project Goal

The objective of this project is to train a deep learning model capable of "optimizing" English sentences. This optimization includes three main aspects:
- **Grammatical Error Correction**
- **Fluency Enhancement**
- **Conciseness Improvement**

We will adopt a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) approach, where the model takes an original sentence as input and outputs an optimized target sentence.

## 2. Core Tech Stack

- **Primary Framework:** PyTorch
- **Core Model:** T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)
- **Supporting Libraries:**
    - `transformers`: For loading pre-trained models, tokenizers, and managing training pipelines.
    - `datasets`: For loading and preprocessing datasets.
    - `torch`: The core PyTorch library.
    - `sentencepiece`: The tokenizer tool used by the T5 model.

## 3. Development Roadmap

The entire development process is divided into the following steps:

### Step 1: Environment Setup

First, we need to set up the development environment by installing all the necessary libraries. This typically involves using a package manager like `pip` to install PyTorch, Transformers, and Datasets.

### Step 2: Data Preparation

This is the most critical step in the project. The model's performance is directly dependent on the quality and quantity of the data. We need paired data in the format of `(incorrect/original sentence, correct/optimized sentence)`.

**Suggested Data Sources:**

1.  **Public Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) Datasets:**
    - **CoNLL-2014 Shared Task:** A standard academic benchmark for GEC.
    - **JFLEG (JHU FLuency-Extended GEC):** A dataset specifically focused on fluency corrections.
2.  **Synthetic Data:** If existing datasets are insufficient, we can generate our own. The method involves:
    - Sourcing high-quality English sentences (e.g., from Wikipedia).
    - Artificially introducing common errors (e.g., randomly deleting/replacing articles, changing verb tenses, swapping word orders).

**Data Format:**
The data should be structured into two columns. For example, in a CSV file:

| input_text | target_text |
|---|---|
| "fix grammar: She dont likes apples." | "She doesn't like apples." |
| "make fluent: I am having good interesting in it." | "I have a great interest in it." |
| "He go to the store yesterday." | "He went to the store yesterday." |

*Note:* Adding a task-specific prefix (like `"fix grammar: "`) to the input text is a common and effective practice when working with T5, as it helps the model understand the specific task it needs to perform.

### Step 3: Model and Tokenizer Loading

We will use the Hugging Face `transformers` library to load a pre-trained T5 model. Starting with `t5-small` or `t5-base` is recommended. `t5-small` is faster to train and is ideal for initial experiments. We will load both the model and its corresponding tokenizer.

### Step 4: Data Preprocessing & Dataset Creation

We need to convert our text data into a format the model can understand, which consists of token IDs. This step involves:
1.  Using the T5 tokenizer to encode both the `input_text` and `target_text` fields.
2.  Creating a custom PyTorch `Dataset` class to wrap our data, which will handle the tokenization and formatting for each data sample. This class makes it easy to feed data into the model during training.

### Step 5: Model Training (Fine-tuning)

This is the core training loop where the model learns from our prepared data. The process involves:
1.  Setting up a `DataLoader` to feed data to the model in batches.
2.  Initializing an optimizer (e.g., `AdamW`) and a learning rate scheduler.
3.  Iterating through the data for a set number of epochs.
4.  In each training step:
    - Perform a forward pass to get the model's output and calculate the loss.
    - Perform a backward pass to compute gradients.
    - Update the model's weights using the optimizer.
5.  After training is complete, the fine-tuned model and tokenizer should be saved to disk.

*Note:* In a real-world project, it is **essential** to include a validation step. This involves evaluating the model on a separate validation set after each epoch to monitor for overfitting and to save the best-performing version of the model.

### Step 6: Inference

Once the model is trained, we can use it to optimize new sentences. The inference process is as follows:
1.  Load the saved fine-tuned model and tokenizer.
2.  Take a new input sentence and format it with the appropriate prefix (e.g., `"fix grammar: ..."`).
3.  Tokenize the input text and feed it to the model.
4.  Use the model's `generate()` method to produce the output token IDs.
5.  Decode the output token IDs back into human-readable text.

## 4. Next Steps & Advanced Topics

- **Model Evaluation:** Use metrics like BLEU or GLEU scores to objectively measure the quality of the generated sentences against a test set.
- **Scaling Up:** Experiment with larger models like `t5-base` or `t5-large` to potentially achieve better performance.
- **Richer Data:** Combine multiple datasets from different sources to improve the model's generalization capabilities.
- **Deployment:** Package the trained model into an API service (using a framework like Flask or FastAPI) so it can be easily called by other applications.
- **User Interface:** Build a simple web-based UI to allow users to easily input sentences and view the optimized results.
